  <h1>The advantages of the OSI model are</h1>
   <ul type="square">
    <li>It is a generic model and acts as a guidance tool to develop any network model.</li>
    <li>It is a layered model.
Changes are one layer do not affect other layers, provided that the interfaces between the layers do not change drastically.</li>
    <li>It distinctly separates services, interfaces, and protocols. Hence, it is flexible in nature. 
Protocols in each layer can be replaced very conveniently depending upon the nature of the network.</li>
    <li>It supports both connection-oriented services and connectionless services.</li>
   </ul>

<h1>The disadvantages of the OSI model are</h1>
<ul type="square">
<li>It is purely a theoretical model that does not consider the availability of appropriate technology. 
This restricts its practical implementation.</li>
<li>The launching timing of this model was inappropriate. When OSI appeared, the TCP/IP protocols were already implemented. 
So, the companies were initially reluctant to use it.</li>
<li>The OSI model is very complex. The initial implementation was cumbersome, slow and costly.</li>
<li>Though there are many layers, some of the layers like the session layer and presentation layer have very little functionality when practically deployed.</li>
<li>There is a duplication of services in various layers. 
Services like addressing, flow control and error control are offered by multiple layers.</li>
